        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A California resident who has provided
                personal information to a business with whom he has established a business
                relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (&quot;California
                customer&quot;) is entitled to request information about whether the business
                has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’
                direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a
                disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California
                customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to
                whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well
                as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>However, under the law, a business is not
                required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and
                discloses to the public (in its Privacy Policy) a policy of not disclosing
                customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing
                purposes unless the business gives users a mechanism to opt out of having their
                personal information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing
                purposes. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the
                customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and
                providing a cost free means to exercise the right.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We have opted for this alternative
                approach. As stated in our Privacy Policy, we give customers a mechanism to opt
                out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties for their
                direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or
                disclose a list of third parties that received your personal information for
                marketing purposes. If you wish to opt-out of sharing your Personal Information
                with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please
