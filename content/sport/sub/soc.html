                contest start time then all contests for that Draft Group will be canceled and
                refunded.         </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If a Draft Group includes only one active
                match but this was not known until after the contest start time then contests
                for this Draft Group will not be canceled.   </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Matches are “known” to be canceled or
                postponed once their status is updated as such by &quot;Spo-Bit&quot;’ SOC
                stats-provider, Opta.    </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Example: If a Draft Group includes two
                matches at 8pm ET and 10:30pm ET respectively, and the 10:30pm ET match is
                officially postponed at 6pm ET then all contests for that Draft Group are
                canceled and refunded. If the 10:30pm ET match was not officially postponed
                until after 8pm ET then contests for that Draft Group are not canceled and are
                played out using only the one active match.  </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If canceled or rescheduled matches result
                in a Draft Group including zero active matches, all contests for that Draft
                Group will be canceled and refunded.       </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>ABANDONED OR SHORTENED GAMES</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Spo-Bit&quot; uses the stats
                provider, Opta, and only includes statistics from matches Opta deems to be
                official. If Opta declares a match &quot;abandoned&quot; then the statistics
                generated before the match is abandoned will count in Draft Groups containing
                said match. Any statistics generated on a later date when the match resumes
                will not be included.   </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>CONTEST ENTRY</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Entry-Fee and Prize Pool for a contest
                will not change once the contest is created. Therefore, each contest has a
                maximum amount of total entries accepted. Contests that have not reached
                capacity will be available for entry up until the contest start time.    </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Guaranteed contests will run (with prizes
                unchanged) even if they do not reach capacity before the contest start time.
                Non-guaranteed contests that do not reach capacity by contest start time may be
                merged with other similar unfilled contests or may be canceled and refunded.          </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>LINEUP EDITS</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Lineups may be edited at any time leading
                up to matches kicking off. Each individual player will become “locked” at the
                scheduled start time of their team’s match. A locked player cannot be added or
                removed from a roster spot. Locked roster spots for all entries are displayed
                in contest GameCenters.     </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If the scheduled start time for a match
                changes after contests for a Draft Group containing that match become
                available, &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; will take measures to ensure the change is
                reflected on Draft Screens and for lineup editing purposes. In the rare case
                that a match starts before the scheduled start time, all players within that
                match will become locked as soon as our feed reflects that the match has begun.
                Additionally, any swaps that were made after the real-life start time of the
                match will result in those lineups being disqualified and refunded.         </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>SCORING AND PAYOUTS</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Live scoring updates are strictly for the
                enjoyment of &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; customers. &quot;Spo-Bit&quot;’ official
                scoring validation process begins once all games within the contest are final.
                This process ensures that &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; scoring matches Opta scoring when
                contest results are finalized and paid out.     </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Once contests are finalized, a contest
                status will update to &quot;Completed&quot;, and that contest will move from
                the &quot;Live Games&quot; section to the &quot;Completed&quot; section on the
                My Contests page.          </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>On occasion, Opta scorers may issue a
                stat-correction after matches have ended and the official scoring validation
                process has completed. These corrections are rare, but can occur days after a
                match is played. Therefore, any changes to official scoring that occur after
                contests have been finalized will not impact those finalized contests.
                Conversely, if a correction needs to be made after contests are finalized due
                to a bug with the data feed or the finalization process, while extremely rare,
                the finalization process (including payment) may be reversed and redone
                correctly.           </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Note: The official scoring validation
                process is solely to ensure that &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; contest results are
                determined based on Opta scoring. Delays during this process may occur as a
                result of data collection or other technical difficulties. &quot;Spo-Bit&quot;
                will not attempt to make judgements on scoring rulings.     </span></p>
