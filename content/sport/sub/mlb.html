        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Player positions are determined at the sole
                discretion of &quot;Spo-Bit&quot;. In general, &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; uses the
                guidelines below to establish player positions. </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Players will be eligible at positions in
                which they started at least 15% of their games started within the season. </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If a player has started at more than two
                positions in 15% or more of their games started then that player will be
                eligible at the two positions in which they have started the most games within
                the season.   </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A player’s position eligibility will be
                determined based upon the previous season’s data up until that player has
                started at least 8 games within the current season. At that point, data from
                the current season will be used for determining position eligibility.          </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Any game started at the DH position will
                not count as a game started for the purposes of determining position
                eligibility. For example, if a player has started 20 games as a DH, 7 games at
                1B and 3 games at OF then that player will be eligible at 1B and OF (1B/OF).     </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For the World Baseball Classic, player
                position eligibility will be at the sole discretion of &quot;Spo-Bit&quot;. The
                above position determinants will not be applied during the salary and player
                pool creation process for the World Baseball Classic.        </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Position eligibility is determined based on

                after contests for a given Draft Group have become available, traded players
                will be eligible to accrue fantasy points for their new team when BOTH teams
                (the player’s old and new teams) are in the Draft Group. Any lineup entries
                that break roster requirement rules because of a trade will be cancelled and
                refunded. Where possible, &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; will notify these users via email

                World Baseball Classic statistics and only includes statistics from games MLB
                or World Baseball Classic deems to be official. If the MLB or the World
                Baseball Classic declares a game &quot;suspended&quot; then the statistics

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>CONTEST ENTRY</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Entry-Fee and Prize Pool for a contest
                will not change once the contest is created. Therefore, each contest has a
                maximum amount of total entries accepted. Contests that have not reached
                capacity will be available for entry up until the contest start time.    </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Guaranteed contests will run (with prizes
                unchanged) even if they do not reach capacity before the contest start time.
                Non-guaranteed contests that do not reach capacity by contest start time may be
                merged with other similar unfilled contests or may be canceled and refunded.          </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>LINEUP EDITS</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Lineups may be edited at any time leading
                up to games. Each individual player will become “locked” at the scheduled start
                time of their team’s game. A locked player cannot be added or removed from a
                roster spot. Locked roster spots for all entries are displayed in contest
                GameCenters.    </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If the scheduled start time for a game
                changes after contests for a Draft Group containing that game become available,
                &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; will take measures to ensure the change is reflected on
                Draft Screens and for lineup editing purposes. In the rare case that a game
                starts before the scheduled start time, all players within that game will
                become locked as soon as our feed reflects that the game has begun.
                Additionally, any swaps that were made after the real-life start time of the
                game will result in those lineups being disqualified and refunded.    </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>SCORING AND PAYOUTS</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Live scoring updates are strictly for the
                enjoyment of &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; customers. &quot;Spo-Bit&quot;’ official
                scoring validation process begins once all games within the contest are final.
                This process ensures that &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; scoring matches official MLB or
                World Baseball Classic scoring when contest results are finalized and paid out.          </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Once contests are finalized, a contest
                status will update to &quot;Completed&quot;, and that contest will move from
                the &quot;Live Games&quot; section to the &quot;Completed Games&quot; section
                on the My Contests page. </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>On occasion, MLB official scorers may issue
                a stat-correction after games have ended and the official scoring validation
                process has completed. These corrections are rare, but can occur days after a
                game is played. Therefore, any changes to official scoring that occur after
                contests have been finalized will not impact those finalized contests.
                Conversely, if a correction needs to be made after contests are finalized due
                to a bug with the data feed or the finalization process, while extremely rare,
                the finalization process (including payment) may be reversed and redone
                correctly.           </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Note: The official scoring validation
                process is solely to ensure that &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; contest results are
                determined based on official MLB or World Baseball Classic scoring. Delays
                during this process may occur as a result of data collection or other technical
                difficulties. &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; will not attempt to make judgements on
                scoring rulings.          </span></p>
