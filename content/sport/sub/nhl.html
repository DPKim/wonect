        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Entry-Fee and Prize Pool for a contest
                will not change once the contest is created. Therefore, each contest has a

                capacity will be available for entry up until the contest start time.    </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Guaranteed contests will run (with prizes

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Lineups may be edited at any time leading
                up to games. Each individual player will become “locked” at the scheduled start
                time of their team’s game. A locked player cannot be added or removed from a
                roster spot. Locked roster spots for all entries are displayed in contest

                changes after contests for a Draft Group containing that game become available,
                &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; will take measures to ensure the change is reflected on
                Draft Screens and for lineup editing purposes. In the rare case that a game
                starts before the scheduled start time, all players within that game will
                become locked as soon as our feed reflects that the game has begun.

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Live scoring updates are strictly for the
                enjoyment of &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; customers. &quot;Spo-Bit&quot;’ official
                scoring validation process begins once all games within the contest are final.
                This process ensures that &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; scoring matches official NHL
                scoring when contest results are finalized and paid out.      </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Once contests are finalized, a contest
                status will update to &quot;Completed&quot;, and that contest will move from
                the &quot;Live Games&quot; section to the &quot;Completed Games&quot; section
                on the My Contests page. </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>On occasion, NHL official scorers may issue
                a stat-correction after games have ended and the official scoring validation
                process has completed. These corrections are rare, but can occur days after a
                game is played. Therefore, any changes to official scoring that occur after
                contests have been finalized will not impact those finalized contests.
