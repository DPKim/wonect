                When drafting your lineup, you-re given $50,000 as a salary cap. Spend this budget
                on players to create your team.

                Choose your players from the Player Pool. A Player Pool consists of all the players
                who will be in a given contest-s game set. For example: a game set for an MLB
                contest may include up to 15 MLB games you can select players from.

                Once you-ve filled all positions in your lineup (unique to each sport) while staying
                under your $50,000 salary cap, you can submit your lineup into the contest.
