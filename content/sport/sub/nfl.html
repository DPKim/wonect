        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>TRADED PLAYER POLICY</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When a player is traded (changes teams)
                after contests for a given Draft Group have become available, traded players
                will be eligible to accrue fantasy points for their new team when BOTH teams
                (the player’s old and new teams) are in the Draft Group. Any lineup entries
                that break roster requirement rules because of a trade will be cancelled and
                refunded. Where possible, &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; will notify these users via email
                and/or other notification features on site.     </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When there is a trade (a changing of teams)
                involving a player in which the team the player has been traded to (their new
                team) is NOT in a Draft Group, the player will remain on his original team (the
                old team) and will be ineligible to accrue fantasy points.     </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Where a player is traded to a team in a
                Draft Group which their old team was not a part of, the player will NOT be
                added to the player pool. </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Where possible, &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; will
                add warnings to Draft Screens once it is known that a player has been traded
                and therefore eligible or ineligible to register points based on the positioning
                of their new and old teams in various Draft Groups. Where possible, users that
                have traded players that are ineligible to accrue fantasy points in their
                lineup(s) may be notified via email and/or other notification features on the

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the event that a game is canceled,
                postponed, or a game is rescheduled to a time outside of the original Scoring

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Scoring Period for NFL is defined as
                the timeframe between the scheduled start of the first game within the Draft
                Group and 11:59pm ET on the first Wednesday after the last scheduled game
                within the Draft Group.  </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Spo-Bit&quot; may choose to adjust
                the Scoring Period for a Draft Group at their sole discretion to accommodate
                schedule changes at any time before 12:00am ET on the date the Draft Group is
                scheduled to start and/or if the adjustment would move the Draft Group start
                time by 15 minutes or less.         </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Any games that are disabled will be
                indicated as such on Draft Screens. Emails and other notifications may also be
                used to notify users of disabled games. </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If canceled or rescheduled games result in
                a Draft Group including only one active game and this is known before the
                contest start time then all contests for that Draft Group will be canceled and
                refunded.         </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If a Draft Group includes only one active
                game but this was not known until after the contest start time then contests

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Games are “known” to be canceled or

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Example: If a Draft Group includes two

                canceled and refunded. If the 10:30pm ET game was not officially postponed
                until after 8pm ET then contests for that Draft Group are not canceled and are
                played out using only the one active game.   </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If canceled or rescheduled games result in
                a Draft Group including zero active games, all contests for that Draft Group

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Spo-Bit&quot; uses official NFL

                the NFL declares a game &quot;suspended&quot; then the statistics generated
                before the game is suspended will count in Draft Groups containing said game.
                Any statistics generated on a later date when the game resumes will not be

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>CONTEST ENTRY</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Entry-Fee and Prize Pool for a contest
                will not change once the contest is created. Therefore, each contest has a

                capacity will be available for entry up until the contest start time.    </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Guaranteed contests will run (with prizes
                unchanged) even if they do not reach capacity before the contest start time.

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>LINEUP EDITS</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Lineups may be edited at any time leading
                up to games. Each individual player will become “locked” at the scheduled start
                time of their team’s game. A locked player cannot be added or removed from a
                roster spot. Locked roster spots for all entries are displayed in contest
                GameCenters.    </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If the scheduled start time for a game
                changes after contests for a Draft Group containing that game become available,
                &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; will take measures to ensure the change is reflected on
                Draft Screens and for lineup editing purposes. In the rare case that a game
                starts before the scheduled start time, all players within that game will
                become locked as soon as our feed reflects that the game has begun.
                Additionally, any swaps that were made after the real-life start time of the

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Live scoring updates are strictly for the
                enjoyment of &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; customers. &quot;Spo-Bit&quot;’ official
                scoring validation process begins once all games within the contest are final.
                This process ensures that &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; scoring matches official NFL
                scoring when contest results are finalized and paid out.      </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Once contests are finalized, a contest
                status will update to &quot;Completed&quot;, and that contest will move from
                the &quot;Live Games&quot; section to the &quot;Completed Games&quot; section
                on the My Contests page. </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>On occasion, NFL official scorers may issue
                a stat-correction after games have ended and the official scoring validation
                process has completed. These corrections are rare, but can occur days after a
                game is played. Therefore, any changes to official scoring that occur after
                contests have been finalized will not impact those finalized contests. Conversely,
                if a correction needs to be made after contests are finalized due to a bug with
                the data feed or the finalization process, while extremely rare, the
                finalization process (including payment) may be reversed and redone correctly.           </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Note: The official scoring validation
                process is solely to ensure that &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; contest results are
                determined based on official NFL scoring. Delays during this process may occur
                as a result of data collection or other technical difficulties. &quot;Spo-Bit&quot;
