                up to games. Each individual player will become “locked” at the scheduled start
                time of their team’s game. A locked player cannot be added or removed from a
                roster spot. Locked roster spots for all entries are displayed in contest
                GameCenters.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If the scheduled start time for a game
                changes after contests for a Draft Group containing that game become available,
                &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; will take measures to ensure the change is reflected on
                Draft Screens and for lineup editing purposes. In the rare case that a game
                starts before the scheduled start time, all players within that game will
                become locked as soon as our feed reflects that the game has begun.
                Additionally, any swaps that were made after the real-life start time of the
                game will result in those lineups being disqualified and refunded.               </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>OFFICIAL GAME LENGTH</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Spo-Bit&quot; will reflect the
                official game length presented on the match detail pages provided by Riot Games
                at lolesports.com. For leagues that do not provide match detail pages, the end
                of game is treated as the point at which the nexus health bar is depleted and
                players become immune to all other actions. The game clock at this event will
                be treated as the official game length.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>SCORING AND PAYOUTS</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Live scoring updates are strictly for the
                enjoyment of &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; customers. &quot;Spo-Bit&quot;’ official
                scoring validation process begins once all games within the contest are final.
                This process ensures that &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; scoring matches official Riot
                Games scoring when contest results are finalized and paid out.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For contests that do not have these
                official Riot Games scores, &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; uses the last shown scoreboard
                on stream along with all kill and objective logs shown on stream beyond that
                point.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Once contests are finalized, a contest
                status will update to &quot;Completed&quot;, and that contest will move from
                the &quot;Live Games&quot; section to the &quot;Completed Games&quot; section
                on the My Contests page.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>On occasion, LoL official scorers may issue
                a stat-correction after games have ended and the official scoring validation
                process has completed. These corrections are rare, but can occur days after a
                game is played. Therefore, any changes to official scoring that occur after
                contests have been finalized will not impact those finalized contests.
                Conversely, if a correction needs to be made after contests are finalized due
                to a bug with the data feed or the finalization process, while extremely rare,
                the finalization process (including payment) may be reversed and redone
                correctly.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Note: The official scoring validation
                process is solely to ensure that &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; contest results are
                determined based on official Riot Games scoring. Delays during this process may
                occur as a result of data collection or other technical difficulties. &quot;Spo-Bit&quot;
                will not attempt to make judgements on scoring rulings.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>PLAYER SALARIES</span></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Spo-Bit&quot;’ player salaries are
                intended to provide an interesting, challenging, skill-based game resulting in
                a top quality experience for &quot;Spo-Bit&quot; customers. Player salaries are
                determined based on historical statistics and aspects of a player’s upcoming
                matchup may be factored into their salary.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Please note that player salaries listed are
                a function of the salary cap fantasy sports contest format and are not
                intended, and should not be relied upon, as any indication of real-life salary
                valuations of the individual players.</span></p>
